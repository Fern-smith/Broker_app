# Broken App Issues

Issues Found in the Original Code
Critical Bugs
1. Missing JSON Body Parser Middleware

Problem: The app doesn't include express.json() middleware
Impact: req.body is undefined, causing the app to crash when trying to access req.body.developers
Fix: Added app.use(express.json());

2. Incorrect Async/Await Usage

Problem: map() creates an array of promises, but the code tries to access .data immediately
Impact: results contains unresolved promises, not actual data
Fix: Used Promise.all() to wait for all promises to resolve before processing

3. Undefined Variable in Catch Block

Problem: catch block references err but it should be error
Impact: Reference error if an exception occurs
Fix: Changed to catch (error) or used proper error handling middleware

Performance Issues
4. Sequential API Calls

Problem: Original code would make API calls sequentially (if fixed)
Impact: Slow response times, poor user experience
Fix: Used Promise.all() to make concurrent API calls

5. No Rate Limiting Considerations

Problem: No handling of GitHub API rate limits
Impact: Could hit rate limits with multiple requests
Fix: Added error handling and logging for failed requests

Code Quality Issues
6. Inconsistent Variable Declarations

Problem: Mixed use of let, var, and const
Impact: Inconsistent code style, potential scoping issues
Fix: Used const for imports and non-reassigned variables

7. No Input Validation

Problem: No validation of request body structure
Impact: App could crash with malformed requests
Fix: Added validation for required fields and data types

8. Poor Error Handling

Problem: Generic try/catch with no specific error handling
Impact: Difficult to debug issues, poor error messages
Fix: Added specific error handling middleware and user feedback

9. No Logging

Problem: No logging for successful operations or debugging
Impact: Difficult to monitor app behavior
Fix: Added console logging for server startup and errors

10. Missing Middleware Organization

Problem: No proper middleware structure
Impact: Harder to maintain and extend
Fix: Organized middleware logically and created helper functions

Security Issues
11. No Input Sanitization

Problem: Username inputs not validated or sanitized
Impact: Potential for malicious inputs
Fix: Could add input validation middleware

12. Exposed Internal Errors

Problem: Internal errors could leak sensitive information
Impact: Security vulnerability
Fix: Added generic error responses for production

Missing Features
13. No 404 Handler

Problem: No handling for non-existent routes
Impact: Default Express 404 responses
Fix: Added custom 404 middleware

14. No Environment Configuration

Problem: Hard-coded port number
Impact: Inflexible deployment
Fix: Added environment variable support

15. No Module Exports

Problem: App not exported for testing
Impact: Cannot write unit tests easily
Fix: Added module.exports = app
